//Project 02. Java Basic
//        Project Objectives:
//        This project was designed to reinforce programming concepts from Chapter 2. In this
//        project, the students will practice:
//        1. Declare variables
//        2. Use Scanner and String objects
//        3. Do arithmetic operations, including /, %
//        4. Use basic data types int
//        Description of the Problem:
//        Write a program that asks the user input a change between 1 and 99 cents. The program
//        then will display it in amount of quarters, dime, nickels and pennies.
//        Example run 1: (the bold Italic numbers/strings are input):
//        Enter a change between 1 and 99 cents:
//        68
//        You have change 68 cents. That is:
//        2 quarters
//        1 dimes
//        1 nickels
//        3 pennies
//        Example run 2:
//        Enter a change between 1 and 99 cents:
//        97
//        You have change 97 cents. That is:
//        3 quarters
//        2 dimes
//        0 nickles
//        2 pennies
//        After finish the program successfully, you need to comment away (donâ€™t delete) the user
//        input part. Replace it by the code that randomly generates a change between 1 and 99
//        cents, inclusive. Run and test the modified program.
//        Submit YourNameProject02.java via blackboard link. The due date is specified on
//        blackboard.
